# convolutional-autoencoder
This project aims (1) to apply a convolutional autoencoder to extract a reduced number of critical features of time-series signals with length of 60 steps, and (2) to test different machine learning classification methods by using the reduced number of features as their input to classify each signal. This project tests Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, as the three machine learning classification models.

This repository contains one ipynb file and one csv file.
